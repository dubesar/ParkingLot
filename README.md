## ParkingLot
##### The task here is to design a parking lot which is able to do the following stuffs:

1. Create free slots for incoming car
2. Register the incoming car with registration number and the color
3. Tell the number of cars with a particular color
4. Tell the registration number of all the cars with the particular color
5. Tell the color of the registered car with a particular registration number
6. Keep a track on the outgoing car and also free the corrosponding slot of the car

#### Project Requirements:
Only Python3 is needed for the code to be run.


#### How to run this repository:
Since there are no libraries used in the code just paste the input.txt file in the main folder and run the code 
```bash 
python3 commands.py
```

For running the unit test file we can write the bash code as:
```bash
python3 test_main.py
```
Testing is done for three methods from the main file:
1. Create Slots
2. Add Car
3. Leave Car

#### Data Structures used: 
1. Hash Tables
2. Lists

##### Bin files :
I was not able to create a bin file as I couldn't find any relevant sources to learn about and make the files executable.

##### Challenges faced:
Having not done any kind of such works in previous time it was hard to find resources to learn but I was able to write each and every line of code myself and testing each and every output. After this project I learned many new concepts not only related to Python but how is it easy to make files executable in different languages such as C# , Java. Learned about unit testing for the first time. Learned about different testing libraries in different languages.
